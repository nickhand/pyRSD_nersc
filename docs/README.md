# Guide to using pyRSD on NERSC

The files in this directory describe how to setup an environment on NERSC that is capable of running [pyRSD](https://github.com/nickhand/pyRSD). We also describe some tools in the ``pyRSD_nersc`` package that make it easier to submit `pyRSD` jobs on NERSC.

Users should read through the following guides:

1. [Setup](setup.md): instructions on setting up your NERSC environment
2. [Submitting jobs](submitting-jobs.md): using `pyRSD_nersc` to submit `pyRSD` jobs
3. [Running batch `pyRSD` jobs](batch-jobs.md): instructions on how to iterate through multiple `pyRSD` jobs, i.e., for multiple simulation realizations
