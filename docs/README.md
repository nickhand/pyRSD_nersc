# Guide to using pyRSD on NERSC

The files in this directory describe how to setup an environment on NERSC that is capable of running [pyRSD](https://github.com/nickhand/pyRSD). We also describe some tools in the ``pyRSD_nersc`` package that make it easier to submit `pyRSD` jobs on NERSC.

New users should read through the following guides to get started submitting ``pyRSD`` jobs on NERSC:

1. [Setup](setup.md): instructions on setting up your NERSC environment
2. [Using the ``rsdfit`` driver](rsdfit-driver.md): guide to calling the ``rsdfit`` executable from a Python script
3. [Submitting jobs](submitting-jobs.md): using `pyRSD_nersc` to submit `pyRSD` jobs
